# 📊 Online Store Sales Analysis – Maju Jaya Digital  

---

## 📌 Problem Statement  

Maju Jaya Digital has experienced steady sales growth; however, overall profitability and the sustainability of long-term revenue remain uncertain. Although management has access to raw performance data, decisions are often made without fully leveraging insights from customer behavior, product trends, and regional differences.  

The lack of a data-driven strategy creates several risks:  

- Sales growth may not align with profit growth  
- Underperforming products or regions may continue draining resources  
- Discounts and promotions may erode margins instead of improving results  
- High-performing segments may be under-leveraged  

To ensure sustainable growth, the company must adopt a systematic analytical approach across sales, customer behavior, product performance, geography, and seasonality.

# Online Store Sales Analysis ‚Äì Maju Jaya Digital  

## üìå Problem Statement  
Maju Jaya Digital has experienced steady sales growth; however, overall profitability and the sustainability of long-term revenue remain uncertain. Although management has access to raw performance data, decisions are often made without fully leveraging insights from customer behavior, product trends, and regional differences.  

The lack of a data-driven strategy creates several risks:  
- Sales growth may not align with profit growth.  
- Underperforming products or regions could continue draining resources without improvement.  
- Discounts and promotions may not significantly impact sales volume.  
- Opportunities in high-performing segments might be missed, limiting the company‚Äôs overall market potential.  

To ensure future growth, Maju Jaya Digital needs to adopt a more systematic approach to analyzing sales, customer behavior, product performance, and regional trends. By addressing targeted business questions, the company can align its marketing, pricing, and operational strategies to maximize profitability, strengthen competitive advantage, and build a sustainable business model.
